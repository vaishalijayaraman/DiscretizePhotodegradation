# DiscretizePhotodegradation

The variables examined are:
* c_pd0 - initital photodegradable group concentration
* I0 - incident light intensity
* L - sample thickness
* D - diffusion coefficient of the free network strands
* ? - the imposed boundary conditions


The material/sample is:
4-(4-(1-hydrooxyethyl)-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy) butanoic acid
